# GroceryMarket
Need for Speed - Most Wanted!

We get our food in 30 mins, but have to wait for a 90 mins slot to get our groceries, and a day or more for our Amazon/ Flipkart shipments. Things shouldnâ€™t be that unfair!
Research and develop a POC which enables as quick as 15 min grocery delivery and same day ecommerce delivery at scale.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Make sure that you have node.js pre-installed on your PC.
If not you can install it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running:
1) Clone this Github repository on your local env or PC.
2) Open terminal and cd to the folder where app.js is located.
3) Run node app.js.
4) The developement server will open in the browser with localhost:3000.
